# 1.1 Change

> The image every TV director in fact or fiction always looks for is the close-up of the human face as it registers change.

John Yorke

> There's no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.

Alfred Hitchcock

# 1.2 Inquisitiveness

There is a natural inclination to resolve information gaps, even for questions of no importance.

There is a positive relationship between curiosity and knowledge. The more context we learn about a mystery, the more anxious we become to solve it.

The place of maximum curiosity is when people think they have some idea but aren't quite sure.

| Mystery is the catalyst for imagination. What are stories but mystery boxes?

JJ Abrams

## Four Ways of Inducing Curiosity

1. The posing of a question or presentation of a puzzle.
2. Exposure to a sequence of events with an anticipated but unknown solution
3. The violation of expectations that triggers a search for an explanation
4. Knowledge of possession of information by someone else

1.3 Perceptionx

| Evolution shaped up with perceptions that allow us to survive. But part of that involves hiding from us stuff that we don't need to know. And that's pretty much all of reality, whatever reality might be.

Donald Hoffman

Show don't tell

> Never use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do. If you mean "More people died" don't say "Mortality rose."
> In writing. Don't use adjectives which merely tell us how you want us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of telling us a thing was "terrible," describe it so that we'll be terrified. Don't say it was "delightful"; make us say "delightful" when we've read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers, "Please will you do my job for me."

CS Lewis

# 1.4 Suggestion

The Kessel Run

# 1.5

# 2.0

A story about people changing their beliefs. Naive realism is the belief that others are biased but we aren't. They don't know they're wrong. But they're about to find out.

# 2.1

## The Five Domains of Personality

1. Extraversion
2. Neuroticism
3. Openness
4. Agreeableness
5. Conscientiousness

All these exist in high or low degrees, like dials turned up or down.

# 2.4

Individualism vs. Collectivism

Western values. The Greeks spin tales of individual heroes triumphing alone. Accounts of struggle and victory. Final answers and closure.
In China, in contrast, Confucian values promote harmony, subordination of self to interest of group. Self-sacrifice for the whole. Taking care of the family, community, country.

## Exerting control

West: reality is composed of individual pieces and parts. When change strikes, attempt to tame these parts.
East: reality is a field of interconnected forces. Bring the forces into harmony so they can coexist.

Controller & enjoyer.

# 2.5

> When we come across any fact or opinion, we immediately judge it. If it's consistent with our model of reality our brain gives a subconscious feeling of yes. If it's not, it gives a subconscious feeling of no. These emotional responses happen before we go through any process of conscious reasoning. When deciding whether or not to believe something, we don't usually make an even-handed search for evidence. Instead, we hunt for any reason to confirm what our models have instantaneously decided for us.

The "makes sense stopping" rule. Happiness Hypothesis
The Political Brain

> Any evidence which suggests are models are wrong is profoundly unsettling. Things are experienced as pleasurable because they are familiar, while the loss of the familiar produces stress, unhappiness, and dysfunction.

Why do we dislike people we disagree with? Why do we feel emotionally repulsed by them?

We spend much of our lives around reassuring ourselves about the accuracy of the hallucinated model world inside our skulls.

We take pleasure in art, media and story that coheres with our models, and we feel irritated and alienated by that which doesn't. We surround ourselves with like-minded people. Our most pleasurable time is spent bonding over the ways we agree we're right, especially on contentious issues.

We don't defend all our beliefs like this. The beliefs we'll fight to defend are the ones which we've formed our identity, values, and theory of control around. An attack on these ideas is an attack on the very structure of reality as we experience it. It's these kinds of beliefs, and these kinds of attacks, that drive our greatest stories.

Much of the conflict we see in life and story involves exactly these model-defending behaviours. It involves people with conflicting perceptions of the world who fight to convince each other of their rightness, to make it so their opponent's neural model of the world matches theirs. Naive realism. Because our hallucination of reality seems self-evident, the only conclusion we can come to is that our antagonist, by claiming to see it differently, is insane, lying or evil. And that's exactly what they think of us.

Ignition point in story: an unexpected change takes place that sends tremors to the core of the protagonist's flawed theory of control.

Will the protagonist fix their flaw or not? Who are they going to be?

# 2.6

Memory becomes a major source of self-justification, one the storyteller relies on to excuse mistakes and failings.

## Four causes of violence and cruelty

1. greed and ambition
2. sadism
3. high self-esteem
4. moral idealism

3 and 4, convictions of personal and moral superiority, drive most acts of evil.

# 2.8

A man's new boss likes to joke with him and he doesn't like it. It hardly seems the stuff of great fiction. But it's of critical importance to the man to whom it happens. It shakes the foundations of the butler Steven's beliefs about how the world operates correctly and who he should be in it. The model of reality he inhabits, inside his skull, comes under threat.

Different kinds of stories have different levels of emphasis and psychological complexity, but plot without character is just so much light and sound. Meaning is created by just the right change-event happening to just the right person at just the right moment.

A character's struggle can be between themselves and the external world. They inhabit a model of the world, inside their skulls, that they experience as reality. Because that model is flawed, their ability to control the real, external world is harmed. When chaos strikes, their model begins to break down. They'll slowly lose control and this will bring them into further conflict with the people and events around them.

Change-events:

- Duryodhana attends the Rajasuya sacrifice, sees the size of the conch and gifts, falls into the pool, is ridiculed.
- Nrsimhadeva questions Prahlada about lessons in school. He can control the universe but he can't control his son.
- Citraketu Maharaja has everything, but all his wealth cannot obtain for him a son. Therefore the world is empty.
- Lord Indra interrupts the aswamedha yajna, to retain control over his position.
