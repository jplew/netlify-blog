# Act Outline

Act 1: The Exposition
Here, the audience learns the setting (Time/Place), characters are developed, and a conflict is introduced.

We are introduced to a young Gurukula boy. He is happy, peaceful, leads an idyllic albeit primitive life. His teachers impress upon the boys the graduation goal of achieving mystic/yogic powers, the most coveted being creating fire from mantra. It has never been achieved, but the boys don't know this, they think it's par for the course.

One day the boys is at the pumps bathing when he feels a presence. Something is different today and he looks up and around, and starts staring intently at a point in the distance, as if he sees something. A mile away, a man is hidden in the bushes with a telephoto lens. Through the lens, the man sees the boy stare right at him, and feels his presence so acutely he drops the camera, panics and leaves.

Act 2: Rising Action

The man flees, traveling through dense jungle and arrives at a riverbank. He has a small inflatable raft which he crosses, and eventually reaches a parked jeep. There, he opens his laptop, transfers the footage and replays it. He has shots of the building, the boys. He picks up his phone and makes a call: "You're not gonna believe this."

Meanwhile, the boy finishes washing his clothes and approaches one of the older boys, a junior teacher. He tells him about the "man with the black cone". The junior teacher asks him for more details, then reports this to the senior teacher. The senior teacher invites the boy to his room to ask him some more questions. The boy is dismissed. The senior teacher announces that he is going for a walk. When he gets far away enough from the school, he looks over his shoulder, pulls out a concealed cell phone and makes a call: "I think we may have been compromised".

The boy

Act 3: The Climax
This is the turning point of the play. The climax is characterized by the highest amount of suspense.

Act 4: Falling Action
The opposite of Rising Action, in the Falling Action the story is coming to an end, and any unknown details or plot twists are revealed and wrapped up.

Act 5: Denouement or Resolution
This is the final outcome of the drama. Here the authors tone about his or her subject matter is revealed, and sometimes a moral or lesson is learned.
