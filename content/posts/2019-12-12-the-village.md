# Outline

We are introduced to a young gurukula boy. He is innocent and lead a life of discipline and rigorous training: physical, mental, and spiritual. The school is a snaphshot from the Vedic age, no electricity or technology, a beautiful building nestled in the forest. There are no women to be seen.

Shots of boys of all ages practicing martial arts: kung fu, archery, horseback riding. Some boys are being tested by fighting blindfolded. Elsewhere we see boys in an open classroom. Many boys are practicing meditation.

The teachers impress upon the boys the goal of purity and celibacy as a means of achieving mystic/yogic powers. The most coveted goal is to create fire by chanting mantras.

One day the boys is at the pumps bathing and washing clothes when he detects a presence in the distance. Something feels different. He scans around, finally landing on a single point in the distance. He stares at it intently. A mile away, in the bushes, a woman is crouched with a telephoto lens. Through the lens, she spies the boy staring right back at her. The woman panics, drops her cover and flees.

She darts through through the dense jungle, peering over her shoulder, and arrives at a riverbank. There she finds her inflatable raft and crosses the river. From there, she to her small camp. She enters her jeep, opens her laptop, and starts transferring and replaying the footage of the boys. She picks up her phone and makes a call: "You're not gonna believe this."

Meanwhile, the gurukula boy finishes washing his clothes and approaches one of the teachers, who is an older school boy. He tells him about the man with long hair and "the black box". The junior teacher asks him for more details. The junior teacher approaches the headmaster's room and requests audience. The headmaster presses the junior teacher for more information, then dismisses him. He sits in silence staring blankly for a moment.

The headmaster goes for a walk. Once he is far enough from the school, he glances over his shoulder, pulls out a cell phone and dials: "We may have a problem."

The boy asks his friends whether they noticed anything different during bathtime. No one experienced anything out of the ordinary. That night, lying awake, curiosity gets the better of the boy. He slips the guards and escapes. He returns to the location where he spotted the woman. He manages to track her steps back to the riverbank.

There he catches sight of a boat on the opposite shore. He swims across the river, follows the tracks further and finds the camp. He creeps in slowly inspecting the jeep with alarm. The woman hears footsteps outside her tent and clutches her gun. "Who's there? I have a gun I'll shoot!". The boy is startled but approaches the tent flap. He peers in and sees a gun drawn at him. The boy freezes as the woman realizes it's the boy from earlier.

## Ending 1

The woman drops the gun, reaches her hand out and starts to speak. However, the boy panics and sprints away. The woman stumbles after him but he is already out of sight. The woman stands on the edge of her camp staring after the boy, uncertain what to do next.

She returns to the school a few days later but the entire gurukula is empty. The facilities are still standing but the campus has been wiped clean.

## Ending 2

The boy stares wide-eyed back at the woman. She stands up and approaches the entrance of the tent. The boy backs away slowly. "Do you speak English?" she asks. "Y-yes, I speak English." "Good. Good. My name is Jane. What's your name?" The boy stares back at her, but from behind him the headmaster appears suddenly accompanied by four school guards. Two guards gently apprehend the boy and lead him away. The head teacher waits for the boy to be out of earshot, then turns to the woman: "Gentlemen, it would appear we have a guest."

Act 3: The Climax
This is the turning point of the play. The climax is characterized by the highest amount of suspense.

Act 4: Falling Action
The opposite of Rising Action, in the Falling Action the story is coming to an end, and any unknown details or plot twists are revealed and wrapped up.

Act 5: Denouement or Resolution
This is the final outcome of the drama. Here the authors tone about his or her subject matter is revealed, and sometimes a moral or lesson is learned.
