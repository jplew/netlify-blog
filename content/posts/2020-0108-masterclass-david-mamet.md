# Introduction

when the student is ready the teacher appears.
When you're ready to learn it you will.

If you have something to fall back on, the circus don't need you. I'll leave, but you have to kill me.

Writers are like beavers. Beavers are constantly wearing down their teeth, so their teeth are constantly growing. They have to use them otherwise their teeth drive them crazy.
Give your mind/consciousness a problem it likes.
How can I get it to shut up for a while?

## Plot is an exercise in cause and effect

What does the character want?
Why does he want it?
What happens if he doesn't get it?
Why now?

## Be analytical

these are theories. This guy is propounding some theories. Apply them, practice them, and test their validity. Let me see if they work.

If this buffoon can succeed, let me see if I can do better.

# 2. The purpose of drama

Sports fans are united by their love for the rules. The absence of rules is barbarism. That which unites the clan is the rules.

Drama has rules. We're given a premise. The hero wants something. We get it.

We're going to follow the hero's journey to the end, which is surprising and inevitable.

## Storytelling creates tribal unity

We're relieved of the burden of our consciousness.
Ways to get free from your consciousness:

1. Getting into trouble
2. sex drugs and booze
3. sports
4. drama

We gather around the campfire. Today that is the television. Drama goes back to the beginning of civilization to the campfire, where the tribe comes together to say "wow, did you see what Grog did to that mountain lion today?" And the other guy says, "I'll tell you one better than that!" We tell stories that unite the tribe. We reinforce our tribal unity. This is how we do things here. We establish this by telling jokes, stories, religion.

Let's put aside the burden of our consciousness for a while, then we can go to bed.

## Everything in life is drama

neurosis is a false relationship between cause and effect

drama is a way of discharging leftover energy, of trying to unravel these relationships of cause and effect. At the end of the drama we realize we were wrong.

We subcconsciously alter real life events to increase their dramatic potential. We tell stories with a surprising punchline. That's all drama is.

"In the end, she left everything to her dog!"
"In the end, Oedipus was the cause of the plague in Thebes!"

We dramatize the weather.

## Good drama doesn't teach

The purpose of drama isn't to make people better, to give them ideas, to reform, to espouse good causes.

The same goes for jokes.

It's not the purpose of drama to be a cautionary tale.

Kids love stories, and the weirder the better. If you can suspend your own rational process and start making the story up as you go, the kid loves it. You're sharing someting that's not rational.

Bad bedtime story is "this is the story of the rabbit that didn't do his homework."

Drama is a bedtime story, that's all it is.

## The only purpose is to entertain

The people don't come to be taught. they come to be entertained. That's enough. If you can take away the burden of their consciousness for a half hour comedy, you've done a fantastic amount. "Who rises refreshed from his prayers, his prayers have been answered."

Imagine your dentist saying: "I'd like to lecture you about my politics." "Here is an investment opportunity I have." You wouldn't have sat in his chair unless the dentist did what he said he was going to do.

Show up to work and shut up. You do your job, that's enough for you. Never do someone else's job, even if they're driving off a cliff.

My job is to entertain. Somebody else's job can be to put on a political show. It should be advertised as such, or else you're tricking people.

## Drama is a form of Myth

Drama is a form of myth. Myth is a poetic statement of an unverifiable reality. It's not false, it's just a statement of truth which is unverifiable.

Drama involves us in the quest of a human being to achieve something.

At every step, this human was trying to achieve something. They underwent traumas I cannot even begin to imagine. They doubted themselves and they wanted to quit. I'm not equal to the task. Yet somehow they found the strength to carry on and achieved a result which elevated them to god status or killed them.

Humans use reason to organize the world. This is what separates us from the animals.

Reason is insufficient, it has the capacity to lead us down the wrong path. "Because I'm reasonable, it's the other person's fault."

All drama is like a joke. It frees us from reason. All drama is: "Why did the chicken cross the road?" It leads us to a conclusion which is both surprising and inevitable. We realize "oh my God my mind doesn't work!"

We believe what we think, and we believe what we're told, and one way to unify us is through prejudice. You can coalesce a group through prejudice. "Let's hate those bad people over there!" That's why I feel so upset.

## Drama frees us from reason

Most of us are nuts. We're hypocrites. We very seldom put our beliefs and our actions in the same box. That's human nature.

We're missing a connection. In the Jewish tradition it's called the evil impulse. The Dark Side. We gotta figure out how to deal with it.

One way to deal with it is religion. The other is drama.

The problem is using the mind to cure the mind.

You're not going to find the soul through reason.
The soul doesn't exist I can't point to it. You can't point to love or patriotism or justice either. They're ideals.

How do we examine our soul? How do we get closer to God, closer to the truth? One way is through drama. By being relieved of the burden of our consciousness.

If reason is the enemy of spirit, then drama/comedy frees us up from reason.

In the Vedic tradition, it's called...

# 3. Dramatic Rules

Your hero wants one thing, and the story is precipitated by an event. It begins when something changes. Aunt Martha dies, and the first nephew or niece that gets to her house gets a million dollars. The story didn't exist before, now it does.

What happens when you get yourself in a situation you can't think your way out of? That's perfect, because the audience can't either.

## Aristotle's rule for story

Hero must be transformed from king into beggar, or beggar into king.

What audience needs to undergo:

- Shock and awe
- fear and pity
  "How is it he didn't see it coming? How did I not see it coming?"

What hero has to undergo:

- Recognition
  - "Oh my god, what have I done!?"
    - this is the punchline of the tragedy
- reversal of situation

## The Hero's Journey

How's he going to get out of this? Or that?
